#  :raising_hand:About Me
<br />
  My name is Varduhi Torosyan and I am a fourth year Computer Science major at UC San Diego.
<br />
<br />
  I have been using C++ for 9 years, and took all my programming classes in Community College using this program. This Fall, I am taking Advanced Data Structures with C++, which would also give me more experience with data driven applications. I took two other programming classes that used Java, and most recently I was introduced to C and Assembly in my Computer Organization and System Programming class.

  Before transferring to UC San Diego, I worked as a program assistant at Extended Opportunity Program and Services program in my community college, which helps eligible students to pay for textbooks and assigns weekly meal vouchers. This program is the largest in the Los Angeles Community College District, and we had to work with large amounts of data in a limited timeline. Additionally, we had to keep up with student GPAs, their units, financial aid availability and whether or not they fulfilled the program requirements.​ ​Some of the work I did consisted of constructing a separate email to each group using HTML, as well as inserting the new student data.​ ​I also had the opportunity to examine how my advisor sorted the student data and efficiently provided any student’s required information while keeping others encrypted.

  I see my future not only as a regular employee of a software company, but I want to make products on my own. I have few ideas, and all of them are meant to benefit college students and improve their education. I want to create a website where already graduated students can share their undergraduate class schedules for each quarter. Next to their schedule they can comment on how they felt each quarter and how hard or easy for them was a certain class. They will have an option to include comments if they recommend other students to follow their plan or try to avoid taking certain classes together.
