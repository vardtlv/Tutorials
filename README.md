# Tutorials

 I often search through the internet to find further explanation of concepts learned in class and some examples of code, while I complete my assignments. During my search I encounter GitHub accounts that explain the concepts in detail, for example the following page: https://gist.github.com/ericandrewlewis/720c374c29bbafadedc9#file-index-md​. I find these pages very useful and want to create my own tutorials. I’m also planning to share my screen while I’m running the code and show my outputs, because it is hard to understand the concepts by just seeing the code and not seeing what is does. In order to include the videos I will download my screen shares to ​https://www.youtube.com​, and would include the links after corresponding codes.
