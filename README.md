# Tutorials :trident:

 Nowadays it is not possible for college students, specifically Computer Science students, to succeed in class only by reading the textbook and going to lectures. Without outside resources such as https://www.geeksforgeeks.org, http://www.cplusplus.com, https://stackoverflow.com, and many others, programming assignments would be impossible to complete. Even professors include links to these websites in assignment prompts to direct students to additional resources that might help to complete the assignments. 
 
 I often search through the internet to find further explanation of concepts learned in class and to find some examples of code. I find these pages very useful, but sometimes the explanations from my peers makes much more sense, because they study the same information with me at the same time and explain concepts in much simpler way. I decided to make these tutorials while I’m taking my data structures class, to be able to explain the concept from a student's perspective and not use complicated formal language that often is confusing.
 
I’m also planning to share my screen while I’m running the code and show my outputs, because it is hard to understand the concepts by just seeing the code and not seeing what it does. 

In this file, you can see the README.md document, which includes the following text and also DataStructures folder, which would explain what is the Data Structures, what is it used for and what are it’s implementations.
