  ## What is Data Structeres
  In a era of massive data consumption, it is very important to store the data efficianty by using minimum space, energy and time. Data Structures is used to organise data, which includes collected the data elements, linking those data elements together and appling different opereations on it, such as finiding an element, deleting it, sorting, etc.
  
  ## Data Structures implemented in C++
  There exist different Data Structures that can be implemented in C++. Some examples would include:
  
   >-   [Arrays](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/)
   >-   [Linked Listst](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/)
   >-   [Queues](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/)/[Stacks](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/)
   >-   [Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-set-1-introduction/)
   >-   [Graphs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5493474/graph-implementation-c)

  ## What is a Hash Table
  Hash Table allows the developers to access the stored elements in effishient time. In order to store the data elements into Hash Table, we have to choose a specific key to represent each data element and compute the Hash Value of the key, using differet Hash Function
