  ## What is Data Structures
  In an era of massive data consumption, it is very important to store the data efficiently by using minimum space, energy and time. Data Structures is used to organise data, which includes collected the data elements, linking those data elements together and applying different operations on it, such as finding an element, deleting it, sorting, etc.
  
  ## Data Structures implemented in C++
  There exist different Data Structures that can be implemented in C++. Some examples would include:

  ## What is a Hash Table
  Hash Table allows the developers to access the stored elements in efficient time. In order to store the data elements into Hash Table, we have to choose a specific key to represent each data element and compute the Hash Value of the key, using different Hash Function
