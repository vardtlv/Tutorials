## What is Data Structures
  In an era of massive data consumption, it is very important to store the data efficiently by using minimum space, energy and time. Data Structures is used to organise data, which includes collected the data elements, linking those data elements together and applying different operations on it, such as finding an element, deleting it, sorting, etc.
  
  ## Data Structures implemented in C++
  There exist different Data Structures that can be implemented in C++. Some examples would include:

  ## What is a Hash Table
  _Hash Table_ is a _Data Strcuture_ that allows developers to access stored data elements in efficient time. In order to store the data elements into _Hash Table_, we have to choose a specific __key__ to represent it. For example, for student's data the key can be their name or the Student ID and for prduct in the store it can be its Item Number. To make the storing and finding the data elements even more efficient we copress the keys by computing it __Hash Values__.
