  In a era of massive data consumption, it is very important to store the data efficianty by using minimum space, energy and time. Data Structures is used to organise data, which includes collected the data elements, linking those data elements together and appling different opereations on it, such as finiding an element, deleting it, sorting, etc.
  
  There exist different Data Structures that can be implemented in C++. Some examples would include:
  
   >-   [Arrays](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/)
   >-   Linked Listst
   >-   Queues/Stacks
   >-   Trees
   >-   Graphs
   >-   Hash Maps
